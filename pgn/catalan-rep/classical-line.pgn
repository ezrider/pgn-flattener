1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O dxc4 7. Qc2 { 7. Ne5 is an interesting sideline but can be met with 7... Nc6! } 7... a6 { Preparing b7-b5 as a response to Qxc4. } 8. a4 { Taking on c4 would be the traditional main line, which allows black to develop the bishop to b7 after 8. Qxc4 b5 9. Qc2 Bb7. } 8... Bd7 { Preparing to develop the bishop to c6 in order to neutralize the catalan-bishop. } 9. Qxc4 { 9. Ne5 Bc6 is fine for black. } 9... Bc6 10. Bg5 { 10. Bf4 is also a move. It's more a matter of taste. 10. Nc3?! can be met by 10... b5! } 10... Bd5 (10... Nbd7 { The most reasonable move, preparing to recapture on f6 with the knight. } 11. Nc3 { Let's keep control over the df5-square and prevent any Bc6-d5 ideas. } 11... h6 { This is the main move, forcing us to give up the bishop pair. } (11... a5 { Is generally a useful move but gives us time to take control over the center. } 12. Rfe1 { Usually I wouldn't recommend moving the rook to e1 but now e2-e4 is very realistic. } 12... h6 { The typical move. } 13. Bxf6 Nxf6 14. e4 { Black was unsuccessful in getting rid of their misplaced c6-bishop which can now become a target for d4-d5 ideas. 14... Bb4 would simply be met by 15. Ne5. }) 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. Rfd1 { This is the ideal square for our rook. We're putting it on the same file as black's queen while overprotecting the d4-pawn in case black ever takes on f3. } 13... Bd5 { Generally this move woulnd't be good because we'd be able to take on d5 with out knight, but here black is completely fine after 14. Nxd5 exd5. } (13... a5 14. Ne5 { I like this approuch to force an exchange of bishops to create a small imbalance of knight vs bishop. } 14... Bxg2 15. Kxg2 c6 16. e3 { We've got a typical small catalan edge. We'll continue setting up our prefered structure } { [%cal Gh2h4] }) (13... Qd6 { Planning to bring a rook to the d-file with additional ideas of possibly offering a queen exchange by going Qd6-b4. } { [%cal Gf8d8,Gd6b4] } 14. e3 { Let's set up the structure while giving our queen an escape square. } { [%cal Gc4e2] } 14... Rfd8 15. a5 { This is a typical idea to clamp down on black's Q-side which makes it difficult for their rook to improve } 15... Qb4 (15... Rab8 { There's not much black can do. The idea of this is primarily to defend the b7-pawn before of taking on f3. } 16. h4 { Putting up the thematical classic catalan pawn-structure. } { [%csl Gh4,Gg3,Gf2,Ge3,Gd4] } 16... Bf8 17. Qe2 { We want the queen on e2 to prepare e3-e4. } 17... Qe7 18. e4 { The engine thinks this is fine for black but I like our position a lot. We've got great control over the center and no concrete weaknesses. }) 16. Qe2) 14. Qd3 { There's really no other square to retreat to and we're preparing e2-e4, which essentially forces black to take on f3. } { [%cal Ge2e4] } 14... Bxf3 15. Bxf3 c6 { PLaying against our catalan-bishop. } 16. e3 { Then we're setting up the typical classical catalan structure. } { [%cal Gh2h4,Gh4h5,Ga4a5,Gg1g2] }) (10... a5 { The third option. The idea is to bring the rook with Ra8-a6-b6. } 11. Nc3 Ra6 (11... Bxf3 { Was played against me once. This is not very impressive as we'll have time to push e2-e4 and keep ahold of the bishop-pair. } 12. Bxf3 c6 13. e4 { Next we'll tuck our dark-square bishop back on e3 behind our pawn. }) 12. e3 { We need to create a retreat-square for our queen to defend the b2 pawn as a response to black's rooklift. } 12... Rb6 13. Qe2 Nbd7 14. Rfd1 { We have a slight advantage. Black's b6-rook is strong but can become a liability if we find a way to harass it. }) (10... h6 { Forces us to give up the dark-square bishop. } 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Nc3 Bxf3 { Taking the time to get rid of the c6-bishop before we're able to go e2-e4. } (12... b5 { Isn't particulary effective now. } 13. Qd3 { We could take on b5 but our d4-pawn would hang in the end. Now black has trouble protecting the b5-pawn and if they go b5-b4 we'd happily go Nc3-e4 with a great position. } { [%csl Rb5] }) 13. Bxf3 Qxd4 { I would've supposed this was the main idea of taking on f3 but apparently it hasn't been played much. } (13... c6 { This is the most popular move but gives us enough time to defend the d4-pawn. } 14. e3 a5 15. b4! { It's quite rare we get to play this break considering black's dark-square-bishop is usually covering the b4-square while situated on e7. } 15... axb4 16. Qxb4 Ra7 17. a5 { I like this way of locking down the Q-side. Next we'll stack our rooks on the b-file and apply pressure on the b7-pawn. }) 14. Qxc7 { Taking on d4 followed by b7 is also fine, but I think this gives us more winning chances. } 14... Qb4 (14... Nc6 { Black chooses to surrender the b7-pawn in hope of getting some activity in return. } 15. Qxb7 Na5 16. Qc7 Qd8 17. Qf4 { Keeping the queens on the board is probably best for us. We have a slight edge and we'll never lose this unless we make a huge blunder. }) 15. Qxb7 Qxb7 16. Bxb7 Ra7 17. Bf3 { Black has some compensation for the pawn but at the end of the day we either draw or win, I don't see how we would be able to lose this. }) (10... b5 { Isn't as impressive now that we haven't commited the knight to c3. } 11. Qc1 { Let's not allow black to harass our queen with Bc6-e4 stuff. We basically have a traditional main line of the catalan, except black has essentially wasted two moves by maneuvering around the light-square bishop. }) 11. Qc2 { I'd say this is a slightly better version of 11. Qc1 because now if black wants to force us back they'll have to go 11... Be4 where the bishop is more of a target. } 11... Be4 (11... Nc6? { This would be a mistake. } 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. e4 { And the bishop is trapped! Black can still go the funny move 13... Ba2!? but we'll simply take it and have two pieces for a rook after 14. Rxa2 Nb4 15. Qb3. } { [%csl Rd5] }) 12. Qc1 h6 (12... Nc6 { Putting pressure on the d4-pawn. } 13. e3 { 13. Nbd2 is the main move but I like this simple approuch, defending the d4-pawn. } 13... Nb4 { With ideas of Nb4-c2. } 14. Nc3 { We're developing and attacking the e4-bishop, which prevents black from going Nb4-c2. } 14... Bc6 15. Rd1 { We've got our typical small catalan edge. The knight being on b4 is a bit strange and it's probably going to stay there for a while. We're going to continue our plan of setting up our pawn-structure and preparing e3-e4. }) 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1 a5 15. Nbd2 Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. Nb3 *
