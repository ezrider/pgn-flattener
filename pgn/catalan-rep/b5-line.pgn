{ This line in the catalan is quite concrete, so it's useful you remember the exact moves. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O dxc4 7. Qc2 b5 8. a4 { We're under-mining black's support of the c4-pawn and there's not much black can do about it. 8...c6 doesn't work for a reason we'll look at soon. } 8... b4 { The main move. } (8... c6? { This is a very common mistake that even occurs on the highest level. } 9. axb5 cxb5 10. Ng5! { Oops! An easily missed move. The a8-rook is trapped and the only way to block the sight of our g2-bishop would be to play Nf6-d5, which would hang mate in one on h7. } { [%csl Ra8,Rh7][%cal Gf6d5,Gf6h7] } 10... h6 11. Bxa8 hxg5 12. Bxg5 { We're a clean exchange up. Black still has some practical chances with the Q-side pawns, but only in short time-controls. }) (8... Bb7 { This is objectively one of black's best moves, but throws any hopes of winning out the window. Their plan is simply to give up a pawn for some positional compensation. } 9. axb5 a6 10. bxa6 { 10. Nc3 is an equally good alternative. } 10... Nxa6 11. Qxc4 { We're now a pawn up. Black is arguing we no longer have the positional catalan edge, but at the end of the day, a pawn is a pawn. } 11... Bd5 12. Qc3 c5 13. Be3 { Let's keep the tension. } 13... Ne4 14. Qc1 { Retreating to e1 is also fine. We're a pawn up with a very safe king and decent piece activity. } { [%csl Gb2] }) 9. Nfd2 { We're preventing black from developing the light-square bishop to b7 while winning the c4-pawn. } 9... Nd5 (9... c6 { The greedy approuch, keeping the d-file open for the queen. } 10. Nxc4 Qxd4 { Black's won a pawn but at the cost of losing a bunch of tempi fleeing with the queen. } 11. Rd1 { Let's not allow black to retreat with the queen along the d-file. } 11... Qc5 12. Be3 { Another tempo gained. } 12... Qh5 13. Nbd2 { Black can't take on e2 because the queen would be trapped due to Bg2-f3. } 13... Ng4 { It's ugly moving a piece yet again in the opening, but here it's almost necessary. They're threatening checkmate on h2 and planning to take on e3 followed by e2. } (13... Nd5 { With the idea of taking on e3 followed by e2. } 14. Nb3 { This is simple. We're just opening up for our queen to defend the e2-pawn while improving our pieces. This is very comfortable for us. }) (13... e5 { This is quite reasonable, preparing to improve the c8-bishop. However, it's quite slow and we should be able to capitalize. } 14. Ne4 { Utlizing the weak d6-square. } { [%csl Rd6] } 14... Ng4 15. h4 { We're clearly better and our piece activity is very harmonious. }) 14. Nf3 { 14. h4 is an interesting alternative, but let's not complicate it. } 14... Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5 { Black needs to make room for the a8-rook or else it might get into trouble in the future. } 16. Nd4 { We're putting pressure on black's primary weakness. } { [%csl Rc6] } 16... Ba6 17. Rac1 { Taking on c6 would hang the e2-pawn in the end. Additionally, there's no reason to let black get out with their pieces. } 17... Rc8 18. Bf3 { Let's gain even more tempi! } 18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 { Now we could go for a draw, but there's really no reason because this position is so low-risk and good for us anyway. } 20. Bd3 { We're trading off black's only decent piece and it's going to be extremely depressing for them. } { [%csl Rb8,Ra8,Rc6] }) 10. Nxc4 c5 (10... Ba6?! { This move order is inaccurate. } 11. Rd1 c5 12. e4 { We no longer have to take on c5. } 12... Nf6 13. d5 $16 { Black needs to continue with some very accurate moves like 13...Bxc4 14. Qxc4 Nc6, but even then we have a very nice advantage. }) 11. dxc5 Ba6 { This is the main move. } (11... Bxc5 { The intuitive response. } 12. e4 Nb6 13. Ncd2! { It might feel a bit unorthodox to move the knight for the fourth time, but the idea is simple. We don't want to exchange the knights, and the b6-knight can also become a target for various a4-a5 ideas. Additionally, the c5-bishop is hanging and black has to react. } 13... N8d7 14. a5 { And the b6-knight is trapped! But wait, it's not over yet... } 14... Ba6 { Our f1-rook is under attack and if we move it, black will be able to develop the a8-rook to c8 with discovery-ideas. } { [%cal Ga8c8,Ra6f1] } 15. axb6 Rc8 { Bxf2+ is a threat. } { [%csl Rc2][%cal Rc5f2] } 16. Qd1 { The strong GM Max Warmerdam once played 16.. Rxa6 against Erigaisi and lost due to the discovered attack. } 16... Bxf1 (16... Qxb6 { The most played move, delaying the capture of the exchanage and avoiding the b6-b7 intermediete move. } 17. Nb3 { There's no way to save the material, but we're already a piece up so it should be fine. } 17... Bxf1 18. Qxf1 { We've got two pieces for a rook and a pawn. Our king is safe and this should be better for us. } { [%cal Gb1d2,Gd2f3,Gf1e2] }) 17. b7! { A very strong in-between move. We can't let black take on b6 with the queen. } 17... Rc7 18. Nxf1 { 18. Qxf1 would actually allow the crazy 18...Bxf2!! } 18... Rxb7 19. Be3 { We're comfortabler better with the two pieces for the rook and pawn. } { [%cal Gf1e3,Gb1d2] }) 12. Ne3 { We're utilizing the pin on the d5-knight. } 12... Nd7 13. Nxd5 exd5 14. c6 { Taking on d5 would not be ideal, since black would quickly be able to develop with Rc8 etc. } 14... Rc8 (14... Nc5 15. Bf4 { Transposes after 15...Rc8. 15. Bg5 is also an alternative if we feel like switching it up. }) 15. Bf4 { Finally we start developing the Q-side pieces. } 15... Nc5 { Is the only reasonable move. Black aims to recapture the c6-pawn by blocking our queen from defending it. } 16. Rd1 { 16.. c7 is tempting, but not particulary useful. Instead let's counter-attack the d5-pawn. } 16... d4 { This prevents us from taking the pawn, but comes at the cost of allowing our g2-bishop to defend c6. } 17. h4 { Black had some ideas of going g7-g5 at some point and we stop it by going here. 17. Be5 is also good, and will likely be played pretty soon. Our main issue is developing the b1-knight, because if we play Nb1-d2, we'll hang the e2-pawn. For this reason we'll probably play Bg2-f3 next, preparing our knight development. } { [%cal Gg2f3,Gb1d2,Gd4d3,Gc6c7] } *
