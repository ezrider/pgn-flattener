1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 Be7 (4... c6 { This is the semi-slav-esc move order. There are a couple differences. } 5. Bg2 Bd6 { This is inferior to 5... Be7 because thge bishop will become a target after we break with e2-e4. } 6. O-O O-O (6... Nbd7 { Now we need to be careful with the move order. } 7. Nfd2 { On 7. Nc3 black is able to grab the pawn on c4 and we'll have to fight to win it back. } 7... O-O 8. Nc3 { Transposes. }) 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. Nd2 { This move wasn't that good when black had a bishop on e7 because then they would be able to play b7-b5. However, here they can't do the same because the bishop would be haning in the end and we would simply be a pawn up. } { [%cal Ge2e4,Gd2c4] } 8... Re8 9. e4 dxe4 (9... e5 { Is necessary to not be a lot worse. } 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. cxd5 cxd5 12. exd5 { Black has some activity but at the end of the day we're a pawn up with a nice advantage. } { [%cal Gd1b3,Gd2e4,Gh2h3] }) 10. Ndxe4 { This position has been won by white in almost 80% of master level games. Need I say more? } { [%csl Rc8,Rd7][%cal Gb2b3,Gc1b2,Gf2f4] }) 5. Bg2 O-O (5... c6 6. O-O Nbd7 { This move order is a bit tricky. If we go 7. Qd3 here, black is able to delay castle to instead focus on the development of the light-square bishop with 7... b6 8. Nc3 a5! with Bc8-a6 coming next. } 7. Nc3 dxc4 { Almost everyone castles and transposes into the other lines, but this is still quite critical because it's not that easy to regain the pawn. } 8. e4 { 8. a4 is also possible and will likely transpose, but we're not really worried of b7-b5 right now. } 8... O-O (8... b5 { Too early. } 9. d5 { Black's king is still in the center! } 9... b4 10. dxe6 fxe6 11. e5 { We're not winning yet but this looks great for us. } { [%csl Re8,Rc4,Rc6,Re6] }) 9. a4 { We can't allow b7-b5 now that black's king is safe. Black can continue with moves like 9... e5 or 9... b6 but looking deeper into the line feels a bit unecessary considering how few take on c4. The ideas are quite simple though. We don't need to rush winning back the c4-pawn. We can just continue our development with Qd1-e2, Rf1-d1 and Bc1-f4. In the end we'll probably be able to regain the c4-pawn with a move like Nf3-d2 since black has trouble defending it with b7-b5. } { [%cal Gd1e2,Gf1d1,Gc1f4] }) 6. O-O c6 { I'd consider this the starting position of the closed catalan, but there are a couple similar variations. We'll learn the different nuances later on. } (6... Nbd7 7. Qd3!? { This rare move is a great way to transpose into the stuff we've looked at thus far. If we played 7. Nc3 black would be happy to take on c4 and we would have trouble recapturing because the c3-knight blocks us from ever playing Qd1-c2 and recapturing it from there. } 7... b6 { This is really the only move we need to look out for. } (7... a6 { Black wants to take on c4 and play b7-b5 just like in the classical line of the catalan. } 8. b3 { This is the simplest way to handle it. If black now takes on c4 we'll just recapture with the pawn. } 8... b6 9. Nc3 Bb7 10. Rd1 { With a very typical catalan edge. } { [%cal Gf3e5,Gc4d5,Gc1b2,Gc1f4] }) 8. cxd5 { We don't want to give black the option to take on c4 and develop the light-square bishop effectively. By taking on d5, the bishop will be poor on b7 since it'll only look straight into their own d5-pawn. } 8... exd5 9. Nc3 Bb7 10. Bf4 { Our queen on d3 looks a bit weird, but this setup from black is so bad that it doesn't really matter. We have a bunch of pressure on d5 and black's only source of counter-play is the c7-c5 break, which doesn't even do much. Whenever black goes Nf6-h5 we don't even need to retreat with the f4-bishop. We could even go e2-e3 and take back with the g-pawn to open up the g-file for a potential attack. } { [%cal Gf1d1,Ga2a4] }) 7. Nc3 { 7. Qc2 is the main move but I love this line. The point is to prepare e2-e4 in the future with a move like Qd1-d3. } 7... Nbd7 { Black is planning to take on c4 now that the e5-square is covered, preventing Nf3-e5 ideas. } (7... b6 { This is the second option for black. We can't play Qd1-d3 here because Ba6 would come too early. } 8. Ne5 { 8. Nd2 is also good but I like this approuch because it's a bit more tricky. } 8... Bb7 { Most people play this, but I'm not a huge believer in this move. } (8... Ba6 { Probably more impressive than 8... Bb7 but a little more rare. I can't even remember ever playing against this... And I've played a lot of catalan. } 9. Re1 Bxc4 (9... dxc4 10. Nxc6 Nxc6 11. Bxc6 Rc8 12. Qa4 { [%cal Ra4a6,Ga4c6] } 12... Bb4! 13. Bf3 Ba5 14. Rd1) 10. Nxc4 dxc4 11. e3 { [%cal Gd1e2] } 11... Nd5 12. a4) (8... Nfd7? { A friend of mine played this after mixing up his lines and he isn't the only one. Several grandmasters have also played this losing mistake. } 9. cxd5 Nxe5 10. dxe5 exd5 11. Nxd5 cxd5 12. Qxd5 { And the a8-rook is dead. } { [%csl Ra8] }) 9. e4 dxc4 { This is probably black's best attempt. } (9... dxe4 { Isn't particulary impressive. } 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Bxe4 $17 { You'll get a bunch of these types of positions and you'll realise how nice it is to play. Our play will mostly revolve around exploiting black's poor b7-bishop and expand on the Q-side. }) (9... Nbd7? { This is a common mistake seen at even master levels. We now have a very pretty continuation. } 10. Nxc6! { Boom! } 10... Bxc6 11. exd5 { It's important we take with the e-pawn. 11. cxd5 would allow black to play 11... Bb7 and it's equal. } 11... exd5 12. cxd5 Bb7 13. d6 { Both bishops are hanging. } 13... Bxg2 14. dxe7 Qxe7 15. Kxg2 { We're a clean pawn up and have an amazing position. } { [%cal Gc1e3] }) 10. Nxc4 Ba6 (10... b5 { Was played against me by Petro Golubka. } 11. Ne3 b4 12. e5 { A useful intermediete move, although 12. Na4 and 12. Ne2 would also work. } 12... Nd5 13. Ne4 { These are the type of positions we get after sacrificing a pawn, except here we aren't even a pawn down. The black king is in big trouble. } { [%csl Rg8][%cal Gd1g4,Gh2h4] }) (10... Nbd7 { Doesn't do much. } 11. e5 Nd5 12. Ne4 { It's like the stars are aligning for us to put a knight on d6. Black's position is just depressing. } { [%csl Rd6] }) 11. b3 b5 12. Ne3 { 12. Ne5 is also playable. } 12... b4 13. Ne2 Bxe2 { This is the only way for black to not be much worse. Their position is so stratigically bad they need to grab a risky pawn. } 14. Qxe2 Qxd4 15. Bb2 Qb6 16. Nc4 Qb5 17. Bxf6! { This might seem like quite a weird move. We want to open up for our catalan bishop by playing e4-e5 without allowing black to plant their knight on d5- } { [%csl Gg2][%cal Rf6d5,Ge4e5] } 17... Bxf6 18. e5 { This is almost impossible to play as black. The b8-knight is stuck and we've got forever pressure on the c6-pawn. } { [%csl Rc6,Rb8,Gg2][%cal Gf1d1,Ga1c1] }) (7... a5 { This is one of the stronger and more modern variations. I first encountered this in Växjö elite hotels open against swedish international master Milton Pantzar. I played incorrectly and got destroyed, but then somehow managed to hold a draw. } 8. b3 { 8. Qd3 b6 is completely fine for black. Let's just keep the c4-pawn defended. } 8... b6 { [%cal Gc8a6] } 9. Bb2 Ba6 { With pressure on c4. } { [%csl Rc4] } 10. Nd2 { We're defending the c4-pawn while preparing a potrential e2-e4 break. } { [%cal Gd2c4,Ge2e4] } 10... b5 11. c5 { We'll go for the e2-e4 break as per usual. } { [%cal Gf1e1,Ge2e4] }) (7... dxc4?! { Doesn't achieve much. We'll simple retake the pawn with a great position. } 8. Ne5 Nbd7 { 8... b5 9. Nxb5 is almost winning for us. } 9. Nxc4 Nb6 10. Ne5 { Since we have a more active position there's no need to exchange pieces. } 10... Nfd7 11. Nf3 { Black is very cramped while we have a typical catalan structure. } { [%csl Rc8][%cal Gd1c2,Gf1d1,Ga2a3,Ge2e4] }) 8. Qd3 { 8. Nd2 is reasonable but allows 8... b5! } 8... b6 { Black somehow needs to develop the light-square bishop. It might go to a6 or b7 next. } 9. e4 { The idea! } 9... Ba6 { Putting pressure on c4. } (9... dxe4 { Probably the most common move on lower levels. } 10. Nxe4 Bb7 (10... Nxe4 { Is just a worse version of 10... Bb7. } 11. Qxe4 Bb7 12. Rd1 { Now we didn't need to play Bf4 and we can advance with d4-d5 whenever black tries to break with c6-c5. }) 11. Bf4 { Taking control over the weak d6-square. } { [%csl Rd6] } 11... Nxe4 { Otherwise we'll plant our knight on d6 and grab the bishop-pair. } 12. Qxe4 Nf6 13. Qe2 { Probably the most accurate retreat with the queen. } 13... c5 { This is completely necessary to play. Otherwise black will be way too passive. } 14. Rfd1 cxd4 (14... Qe8 { I faced this in a recent tournament. } 15. Ne5 { I went for 15. d5?! which looks good but is too dynamic and black can probably equalize. Swapping off the light-square bishops is not something you should be scared of, we have a lot of activity. } 15... Bxg2 16. Kxg2 cxd4 17. Rxd4 $16 { We've got a very comfortable advantage. }) 15. Nxd4 { Rook takes is also playable, but I prefer this. } 15... Qc8 (15... Bxg2 { Is a slightly worse version of 15... Qc8. } 16. Kxg2 Qc8 17. b3 { We'll then go into an endgame with a 3 on 2 Q-side majority. White is better. }) 16. b3 { Solidifying our structure. } 16... Rd8?! { This is one of the more common moves, but a mistake for a pretty reason. } (16... Bc5 17. Nb5 { We'll jump into the weak d6-square and go into a favorable endgame sooner or later. } { [%cal Gb5d6] }) 17. Nf5! { Boom! } { [%cal Rf5e7,Rg2b7,Rd1d8] } 17... exf5 18. Qxe7 Bxg2 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Qxd8+ Rxd8 21. Kxg2 { This is a great endgame. Black's f-pawns are doubled and we can never lose this. }) (9... Bb7 { This is decent but quite rare. The bishop will get pretty poor as soon as we close the position. } 10. cxd5 { It's useful to take first to avoid dxc4, which would open up for the b7-bishop. } 10... cxd5 11. e5 Ne4 12. Be3 { This is a very typical advanced closed catalan. There's a lot of beautiful games from these types of positions where white creates a slow but deadly attack on the K-side. } { [%csl Rb7] }) 10. b3 { We need to defend it of course. } 10... Rc8 { This is most common. Black wants to play c6-c5 and blast open the center. } (10... dxc4 { This is a very tricky move and it can go bad quickly for us if we don't know what we're doing. } 11. bxc4 e5 12. Ne2! { This is a very important move. We're over-protecting the d4-pawn because if we push it forward, we'd be giving up the c5-square. } 12... Qc7 13. Qc2 { This might look a bit weird at first glance, but it's prophylaxis against a potential Nd7-c5 at some point in the future. I could go on for a couple more moves but black has a few of options to choose from, and this variations is already quite rare. Next we'll most likely develop the bishop to b2 and put a rook on the d-file. }) 11. e5 { 11. Rd1 is also plausible, but we'll have to go e4-e5 at some point anyway, and why should we allow complications with an early c6-c5? } 11... Ne8 (11... dxc4 { Quite an interesting in-between move to get access to the d5-square. } 12. bxc4 Nd5 13. a4 { We need to keep control over the b5-square. } { [%csl Gb5] } 13... Nb4 14. Qe2 c5 15. Nb5 { Black has got some concrete problems to solve. On 15... Bb7 we could even grab the pawn on a7 if we feel like it. } { [%csl Ra7] }) 12. Rd1 { Let's step out of the pin. One piece at a time. } 12... Nc7 { Preparing b6-b5. } { [%cal Gb6b5] } 13. a4 { This is very typical. We're keeping control over the important b5-square, and black is almost paralized because their position is so cramped. } { [%csl Rb5] } *
